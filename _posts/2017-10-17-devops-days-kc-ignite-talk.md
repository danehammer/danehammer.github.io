If you're unfamiliar, ignite talks are 5 minute talks with 20 slides. The slides auto-advance. At DevOpsDays KC they had 5 or  of these in a row both afternoons. It's a great way to get excited about several ideas and pick what you want to follow up on.

They also do the most hilarious, although torturous version of ignite talks at DevOpsDays KC, "Ignite Karaoke." This is a volunteer going on stage with a slide deck they haven't seen, with 20 random images. You try and make a talk that uses the slides, on the fly. It's a blast, and if the speaker can improv a bit it's pretty entertaining for the audience. I did one of those too (thus my start of "this time I know the content!"), we'll see if a recording gets posted.

Okay here's the video:
