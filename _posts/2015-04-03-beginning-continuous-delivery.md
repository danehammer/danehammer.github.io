title:  "Beginning Continuous Delivery"

After finishing The Phoenix Project, I was on a high. I was sharing every
highlight from my Kindle app with every person I talked to. I kept referring
to the book whenever we realized there was an inefficiency in the way we were
working. Before I talk about Continuous Delivery, I want to share some of those
highlighted passages and why they resonated with me. Some of these quotes would
make me bust out laughing, because it felt like they were documenting what I had
seen around me, not adding comedic rests to a fictious narrative.

* _Practically every executive in the company is guilty of going directly to their favorite IT person..._
  * This didn't stand out to me so much about the executives, but the lack of
  rigor in following the process. DevOps, and Continuous Delivery along with,
  are not so much about tools as they are about rethinking your process. The way
  we traditionally have developed and delivered software has become less and
  less effective compared to the expectations we have for ourselves. This quote
  stood out to me, because executives are in charge of running the company
  effectively, and yet they were undermining themselves. It just shows that when
  your place needs some DevOps, you're often already quite unsatisfied with
  doing work according to your existing processes. It's just not efficient
  enough to get you there.
* _Remember, any improvement not made at the constraint is just an illusion,
yes?_
  * If you don't look at your system of work in entirety, from idea to delivery,
  across team and organization boundaries, you could very well be optimizing
  a section of the pipeline without any real impact to the business or the
  consumer.
* _Unplanned work has another side effect. When you spend all your time firefighting, there's little time or energy left for planning. When all you do
is react, there's not enough time to do the hard mental work of figuring out
whether you can accept new work._
  * Oh how true this is. How many a stressed, frantic Ops person I have talked
  to that thinks prioritizing or grooming their backlog is futile, because
  they won't get to work on it any way, there'll be another alarm before the
  grooming meeting is over.
* _Improving daily work is even more important than doing daily work._
  * This, and a direct mention of Jez Humble et al. who have gotten the
  Continuous Delivery conversation really roaring, really got me thinking about
  where can I attack our current inefficiencies. Software rusts, entropy is a
  law of the universe. So if you're not continuously improving the way you do
  your daily work, you're guaranteed to churn out less and less quality stuff as
  time progresses.

So when I finished reading, I was immediately ordering the [Continuous
Delivery][2] book from Jez Humble, the next morning I was watching his [talk][1]
from 2013, and now I'm off. I have a new hero, this guy is describing all the
problems I see around me, and he has an answer I can't wait to go and try. Next
post will probably be on how that first attempt to employ some of his
techniques go. I have a hunch, though, that it's going to be in the realm of
Continuous Integration. If you've watch the aforementioned talk, I might have
already ordered a rubber chicken and a bell.
